# Introduction to R

This repository houses the 5-session `Introduction to R` course run at the MRC LMS. 

This course introduces `R` and `RStudio` and walks through the fundamentals of 
programming and data science.

Sessions 1 and 2 cover usage of the `R` programming language and how to import/export 
and manipulate data. Session 3 covers the world of `R` packages and walks through 
a practical analysis example to reinforce the first two sessions. Session 4 covers 
graphing using the `ggplot2` library and discusses visual theory and how to effectively
use colour. Session 5 finishes the course by introducing the concepts of 'tidy' 
data and the programs of the `tidyverse`.
